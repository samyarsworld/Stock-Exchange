Before getting started on this assignment, we’ll need to register for an API key in order to be able to query IEX’s data. To do so, follow these steps:

Visit iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/.
Select the “Individual” account type, then enter your name, email address, and a password, and click “Create account”.
Once registered, scroll down to “Get started for free” and click “Select Start plan” to choose the free plan.
Once you’ve confirmed your account via a confirmation email, visit https://iexcloud.io/console/tokens.
Copy the key that appears under the Token column (it should begin with pk_).
In your terminal window, execute:

$ export API_KEY=value

*check where its gone using env command
